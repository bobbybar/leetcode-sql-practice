(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
 

Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.

SELECT contest_id, ROUND(COUNT(a.user_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Users) * 100, 2)as percentage
FROM Users a JOIN Register b ON (a.user_id = b.user_id)
GROUP BY contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC;
