A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

WITH salary_rank AS (
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT b.name AS Department,  a.name as Employee, salary AS Salary
FROM salary_rank a JOIN Department b ON (a.departmentId = b.id)
WHERE rnk BETWEEN 1 AND 3;
